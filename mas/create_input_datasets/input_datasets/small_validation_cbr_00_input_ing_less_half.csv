Continue to cook over a medium heat, turning until all sides are golden brown and the meat is cooked thoroughly. When the pieces finish cooking, they should be removed and placed on a paper towel to allow grease to drain. ; name: semolina s chicken cordon bleu pasta ; ingredients: chicken breasts, ham, vegetable oil, garlic, parsley, penne rigate, fontina cheese, parmesan cheese, breadcrumbs, alfredo sauce ; preparation:Brown chicken.
