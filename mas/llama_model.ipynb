      "name: Swabian noodles spatzle ; ingredients: flour, salt, egg, water ; preparation:Fill large kettle half-full of water and bring to a boil. Combine flour, salt and eggs in a medium-sized mixing bowl, stirring with a fork. Add water until batter stretches 6 - 7 inches before tearing when pulled up on a spoon. Place large spoonful of batter on wooden cutting board, tilt it over kettle and slice thin strips of batter off into the boiling water. Dip knife into cold water between slices to prevent batter from sticking. Cook for 1 - 2 minutes and remove from a slotted spoon. Drain and place in a warmed serving bowl. Continue until batter is gone. ; name: Fluffy strawberry jello dessert ; ingredients: strawberry jell-o gelatin dessert, boiling water, vanilla ice cream, ice cubes, whipped cream, strawberry ; preparation:Combine jello and boiling water in container of electric blender. Blend for one minute. Add ice cream and ice cubes one at a time. Blend 2 minutes. Pour into serving dishes. Refrigerate until ready to serve. Top with whipped cream and a strawberry for garnish. ; name: Amish sweet and sour red cabbage ; ingredients: bacon, onion, tart apples, red cabbage, cider vinegar, brown sugar, ground allspice, salt, black pepper ; preparation:In a heavy saucepan, cook the bacon, onion, and apples over medium-low heat until onions are limp, about 3 minutes. Add the cabbage. Cook about 10 minutes, uncovered, over medium heat until the cabbage wilts, stirring now and then. Add the remaining ingredients. Reduce heat to low, cover, and cook for 20 minutes. The cabbage should be moist, but not juicy. If liquid accumulates, remove lid at the end of the cooking period to cook off some liquid. If sauerkraut is not served at a holiday table, this might be a very delicious substitute. The addition of bacon to the traditional sweet-and-sour red cabbage gives it smoky undertones. This can be made in advance and reheated. For vegetarians, substitute a little smoke flavor for the bacon. ; name: Witch s brew ; ingredients: sparkling wine, orange juice, orange sherbet, sugar, carbonated lemon-lime beverage, vodka, dry ice, grapes ; preparation:Combine champagne and orange juice in large punch bowl. Scoop sherbet into bowl. Add sugar to taste if desired. Float peeled grapes in mixture, and garnish bowl with the rest of the grapes. Drop in pieces of dry ice for steaming effect, but. You can add more or less vodka depending on your preferences, or leave it out completely. ; name: Rosemary polenta pound cake ; ingredients: buttermilk, polenta, flour, baking powder, baking soda, salt, fresh rosemary leaves, unsalted butter, sugar, eggs ; preparation:Mix together buttermilk and polenta. Let soak for 45 minutes. Preheat oven to 350. Butter and flour two 8-inch tube cake pans. Sift together flour, baking powder, baking soda and salt. Stir in rosemary. Cream together butter and sugar until white and fluffy. Add eggs 1 at a time, beating well after each addition. Fold polenta and dry ingredients alternately into creamed mixture, in 3 additions. Divide batter between prepared pans. Bake about 40 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into cake comes out clean. Let cakes cool 5 minutes before turning out on a wire rack to cool. ; name: Chinese marble cookies ; ingredients: vegetable shortening, sugar, egg, flour, salt, baking soda, cream of tartar, vanilla, unsweetened chocolate ; preparation:Preheat oven to 400 degrees. Beat the shortening with sugar and egg until light and fluffy. Add egg, then vanilla. Add dry ingredients and beat until well combined. Add chocolate a little at a time, cutting in with a knife. Do not stir. Form dough into balls and place on an ungreased cookie sheet. Flatten with the bottom of a sugar-coated glass. Bake 8 to 10 minutes until lightly golden. Baked them for 15min. ; name: Chicken salad oriental ; ingredients: cooked chicken, pineapple tidbits, green onions, water chestnuts, sour cream, ground ginger, salt, pepper, slivered almonds ; preparation:Combine and chill first four ingredients. Blend sour cream, ground ginger, salt, and pepper. Add to chicken mixture. Toss lightly. Serve on bed of greens. Sprinkle with toasted almonds. ; name: Chicken biscuits ; ingredients: biscuit dough, boneless skinless chicken breasts, garlic, frozen mixed vegetables, dry white wine, water, black pepper, low-fat condensed cream of chicken soup ; preparation:\n",
      "Preheat oven to 400 degrees F. Press 1 biscuit into each of 6 ungreased muffin cups. Bake 5 minutes. In 12-inch skillet, saut chicken, garlic, and vegetables in wine until tender.
