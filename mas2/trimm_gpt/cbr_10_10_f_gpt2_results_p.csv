Preheat oven to 400f degrees. Place fish in baking pan. Mix orange juice and butter. Pour half this mixture over the fish. Sprinkle the rind over. Bake for 10 minutes. Pour remaining orange mixture over. Bake another 10 minutes. Sprinkle with parsley.
"Preheat oven to 350f. In a large mixing bowl, with electric mixer at medium speed, beat together butter and shortening until light and fluffy. Add sugar and cream together until very light. Add vanilla, scraping down sides of bowl as needed. Add eggs one at a time, beating well after each egg. Gradually fold in flour until a soft, workable dough forms. Shape into balls and place on cookie sheets. Dip the bottom of a flat bottomed glass in sugar and use it to mash down the balls of dough. Bake in preheated oven until done. Immediately remove from pan to cool."
Melt butter in a pot. Take off the heat and add to mixture. Mix evenly. Put sifted dry ingredients. Roll into balls and place on a greased oven tray and flatten. Place a chocolate button in the centre of each biscuit. Bake for 15 - 17 minutes at 175c.
"Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Spray a 13x9 pan with pam. Put hash browns in pan and add salt and pepper to taste. Top with grated cheese and pour half and half over top. Drizzle with melted butter. Sprinkle with paprika, if desired. Bake for 1 to 1. 5 hours. I like to cover mine with foil and then uncover the last half an hour."
