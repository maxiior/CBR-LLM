Add vanilla, scraping down sides of bowl as needed. Add eggs one at a time, beating well after each egg. Gradually fold in flour until a soft, workable dough forms. Shape into balls and place on cookie sheets. Dip the bottom of a flat bottomed glass in sugar and use it to mash down the balls of dough. Bake in preheated oven until done. Immediately remove from pan to cool."

Top half of the omelet with apple slices, cheese, and chives and fold in half. Slip onto a plate and serve immediately."
