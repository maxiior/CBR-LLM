First you will want to soak your pecans in water overnight. This will soften the nut and make it easier for them to stick together. You can also use this method if you are going to dip your pecans in chocolate. The next day you can drain your pecans and lay them out on a plate. I like to use a paper plate for this. You will want to take each pecan and place it on its side with the point of the pecan facing the edge of the plate. Now take a small piece of cheese and place it right on the point of the pecan. You can also cut the cheese in half and place it on both sides. I also like to add a small amount of cinnamon and nutmeg to the cheese. Next take an apple slice and place it on the cheese. Now you are going to take the pecan and press down on the cheese and apple to secure them together. Then you can lay them out on the dehydrator tray. You will want to dehydrate them at 125 for about 12 hours. When they are done they will be a little soft so you will want to let them sit,120002
