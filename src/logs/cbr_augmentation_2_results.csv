You may have noticed that I posted this recipe for the first time yesterday. Well I have to say that I was a bit disappointed because I made these for dinner last night and my family did not eat them.
They did not eat them because they were too spicy for their taste.
The only thing I can think of is that I used hot pepper flakes and they are not used to that.
So I decided to try it again today. This time I used only half of the hot pepper flakes that I did yesterday. I also used a little less of the cajun seasoning that I did yesterday.
They loved them. They ate every single one of them.
If you are looking for a way to get more vegetables in your diet then these are the perfect thing for you.

The one that I liked the best was the Mango Mojito. I used some fresh mango that I cut up and added to it instead of using canned mango. I also added some fresh mint leaves to it as well as fresh limes. I thought that it was really good.
