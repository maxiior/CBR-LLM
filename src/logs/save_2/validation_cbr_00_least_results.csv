Preparing them is easy - just remove all the peel from one of your navel oranges and cut in half, then remove any seeds you find inside the fruit. Take one half of your fruit and cut it into small sized segments so you can see inside. Place your navel orange segments in an empty jar along with your caster sugar and vanilla bean. Top them off with your chosen liqueur (I prefer Grand Marnier) and then top them off again with brandy. You may have some space in your jar but that is OK - just make sure you cover all of your fruit segments with your brandy. Leave your jar somewhere cool (in your fridge if possible) and leave it there over night. The next day you will notice that your fruit has swollen up into little juicy liqueur oranges which are ready to be eaten straight from the jar.
