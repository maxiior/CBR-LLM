Chocolate is an essential ingredient in many recipes and is one of the most popular flavors in the world.
Chocolate comes from the seeds of the Theobroma cacao tree. The seeds are fermented and dried and then roasted. The seeds are then crushed and ground into a paste known as cocoa mass. This paste is then pressed and the remaining oil is removed and the resulting solid is known as cocoa butter.
Chocolate is often combined with other flavors such as peanut butter, mint, and coffee to make some of the most popular confections and beverages.
Chocolate is thought to have originated with the Olmecs of the ancient Mayan civilization and was used as early as 900 B.C.
Today's chocolate is made by combining the cocoa mass with the cocoa butter and adding other ingredients.
