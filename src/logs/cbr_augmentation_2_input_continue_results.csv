Today I did a little experiment with some fresh jalapenos I got at the farmer's market the other day. I like to get the fresh jalapenos so I can make my own jalapeno jelly. I made some a while back and was reminded how delicious they are as I was enjoying my pizza last night.
I like to make my own jalapeno jelly because I really do not like the commercially made ones that have little bits of jalapeno floating around. I have tried the ones with the seeds taken out and they are not even close to the ones with the seeds still in them. The seeds add the most flavor to the jelly and I like my jalapeno",313149

We have a couple of friends who are getting married soon and I wanted to make some bridal shower food to take with me. So I decided to do some searching and came up with this idea.
It's a pretty simple idea -- just make a bunch of recipes for different types of salads that will travel well and then bag them up and freeze them. Then I'll just thaw them out when I'm ready to go to the shower!
I also wanted to make sure that the salads would be easy to eat at the shower since the shower is scheduled for the day after work (on a work day!), so I decided to use only finger foods!
I made some finger sandwiches for the shower as well, but I'll save those recipes for another day!
This recipe was delicious and is perfect for any summertime picnic!

I used boneless skinless chicken breasts instead of the pork chops for the Sweet and Sour Pork recipe. I also used 1/2 cup brown sugar instead of the white sugar. It was really good but I will cut back on the sugar next time I make it.
I made the Tomato Onion Pork Chop recipe tonight for supper. It was very good but next time I think I will cut back on the brown sugar since it was kind of sweet for my taste.
