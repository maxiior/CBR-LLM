Hunger is a powerful motivator that drives people to find food even when the food is not healthy, as the researchers found when they asked study participants to recall their last unhealthy snack or meal. They found that the hungrier people were when they ate the food, the more likely they were to rate that food as tasty, satisfying and healthy.
""Even if the food is not nutritionally dense or healthy, people will still find it to be tasty, satisfying and healthy if they're hungry,"" said lead author Brian Wansink, professor of marketing at Cornell University. ""This shows that when we're hungry, we tend to forget about healthy foods and go for unhealthy foods.""

I feel like I’m the person who is making the food. I feel like I’m the person who is enjoying the food. And that’s why I think the best food blogs have a lot of pictures of food.

Fresh or frozen? Which type of pea is best?
The health benefits of frozen and canned vegetables are almost always the same as the benefits of fresh vegetables. Some nutrients may be lost during the freezing or canning process but in general these nutrient losses are minimal. In addition, frozen and canned foods are usually less expensive and often more convenient.
